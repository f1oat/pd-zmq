FIRST
* make close not crash
* go through: https://github.com/imatix/zguide learn how zmq works and while at it, rip out all relevant code-blocks ;)
* proper message handling
** multipart messages
** pd types conversion
* condition checking
** what client types can be initiated on what socket types etc
** distinguish between PAIR and non-PAIR sockets
* proper architecture workflows
** multiconnects/multicast (pgm?)
** specific disconnects
* status information and control
** properly use getsockopt
* read docs, examples, other lang bindings

LATER
* special purpose objects [zmf_router], [zmf_pair], ...
* implement streams to send audio blocks
** binary messages
* take care of different zmq versions
