BUGS
* crashes when binding to port already in use by another zmq agent
* crashes when sending on an unconnected socket

FIRST
* compatibility with netsend FUDI/binary
** lists
** numbers
* close/destroy properly: http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Making-a-Clean-Exit
** multipart messages
* proper architecture workflows
** multiconnects/multicast (pgm?)
** specific disconnects
* status information and control
** properly use getsockopt
* read docs, examples, other lang bindings

LATER
* special purpose objects [zmf_router], [zmf_pair], ...
* implement streams to send audio blocks
** binary messages
* take care of different zmq versions
