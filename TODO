FIRST
* go through: https://github.com/imatix/zguide learn how zmq works and while at it, rip out all relevant code-blocks
* proper message handling
** multipart messages
** pd types conversion
*** lists
*** numbers
* proper architecture workflows
** multiconnects/multicast (pgm?)
** specific disconnects
* status information and control
** properly use getsockopt
