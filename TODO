BUGS
* crashes when binding to port already in use by another zmq agent
* crashes when starting receiver on REPL socket

FIRST
* cleanup Makefile
* close/destroy properly: http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Making-a-Clean-Exit
* status information and control
** properly use getsockopt
** custom state tracking (socket_state)
* read docs, examples, other lang bindings
* external sample programs

LATER
* proper architecture workflows
** multiconnects/multicast (pgm?)
* special purpose objects [zmf_router], [zmf_pair], ...
* implement streams to send audio blocks
** binary modes
* send/receive modes
** binary (for audio/video frames)
** string (for communication w external programs)
